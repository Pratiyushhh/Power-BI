# 📉 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis – Identifying Revenue Risk & Strategic Retention Opportunities

A Power BI dashboard project analyzing customer churn behavior, revenue impact, and strategic retention opportunities for a fictional telecom company serving 7,000+ customers across California.

## 📊 Overview

This project explores real-world churn patterns and helps answer:

- Who is churning — and what do they look like?
- What are the top reasons for customer churn?
- Are we losing **high-value, long-tenure customers**?
- What strategies can reduce churn and protect revenue?

The dashboard delivers **data-backed insights** and **executive-level recommendations**, built for business decision-makers.
