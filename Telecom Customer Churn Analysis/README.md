# 📉 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis – Identifying Revenue Risk & Retention Opportunities

A Power BI dashboard project analyzing customer churn behavior, revenue impact, and strategic retention levers for a fictional telecom company serving over **7,000 customers** across California.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores real-world churn patterns and provides data-backed answers to critical business questions:

- Who is churning — and what do they look like?
- Are we losing **high-value or long-tenure customers**?
- What are the primary churn drivers?
- Which strategic actions can help reduce churn and protect revenue?

The final dashboard is designed for **business leaders, product managers, and retention teams** — delivering insights, segmentation, and **executive-ready recommendations**.

## 💡 Key Insights

- 💸 Over **$3.6M in lost revenue**, with **50% attributed to the top 25% of customers**
- 📉 Churn rates spike for **monthly contract holders**, especially with low tenure
- 📌 Churn is primarily **competitor-driven** — due to pricing, data limits, and service reliability
- ⚠️ Customers with **<3 services**, **no add-ons**, or **manual billing** are at higher risk
- 👴 Seniors aged **50+** show elevated churn trends, especially without digital payment methods

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

- 🎁 Deploy targeted **loyalty offers** for high-value churn-risk segments  
- 🔒 Promote **value-added bundles** (Tech Support, Protection, Security) to increase retention  
- 🧾 Encourage **paperless billing** via discounts to reduce churn in manual payers  
- 💬 Launch **win-back campaigns** focused on competitor-driven churners
