A Power BI dashboard exploring real-world survey data from 600+ global data professionals to uncover actionable insights on **compensation**, **career movement**, **job satisfaction**, and **workplace priorities**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes a global dataset shared by [AlexTheAnalyst](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst), focusing on trends across roles, education, gender, geography, and career pathways.

The dashboard is designed for **business leaders, HR teams, and workforce strategists** who want to understand:
- What roles and skills yield the highest compensation?
- How do career switchers fare in the industry?
- What drives job satisfaction and career moves?
- Are gender gaps present — and where?
- How do education levels impact earnings?

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- 🎓 **PhD holders** command the highest median salaries — up to **$147K**  
- 👩‍💻 **Female professionals** earn slightly more on average, despite being underrepresented  
- 🔄 **Career switchers** earn comparably to direct entrants — especially with higher education  
- 🧘‍♂️ **Remote work, salary**, and **work-life balance** top job-change motivators  
- ❗**High income doesn’t guarantee satisfaction** — salary satisfaction remains modest even in higher-paying roles

---

- 📈 Career support for **switchers** is essential, as they show high mobility and potential
