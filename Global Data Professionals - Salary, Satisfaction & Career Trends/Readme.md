A Power BI dashboard exploring real-world survey data from 600+ data professionals across the globe — designed to uncover actionable insights on compensation, career movement, job satisfaction, and workplace priorities.

## 📊 Overview

This project analyzes key workforce trends among global data professionals using a publicly sourced dataset from [AlexTheAnalyst](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst).  
It combines interactive storytelling and DAX-driven metrics to answer questions like:

- What roles and education levels earn the highest salaries?
- How do gender and geography impact compensation?
- Are career switchers at a disadvantage?
- What do data professionals value most when switching jobs?
- Does high pay lead to high satisfaction?
